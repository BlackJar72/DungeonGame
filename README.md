At this point I'm simply prototyping and experimenting with a system for using 
small prefab dungeon geomorphs as the basis for a tiles based 3D game (not a 
full voxel games).  The plan for this is to create a kind of Roguelike FPS game 
with fast play and simple mechanics.  It turned into something like a horror 
walking simulator becuase of a mix if engine shortcoming and my inaptitude.
