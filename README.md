At this point I'm simply prototyping and experimenting with a system for using 
small prefab dungeon geomorphs as the basis for a tiles based 3D game (not a 
full voxel games).  The plan for this is to create a kind of Roguelike FPS game 
with fast play and simple mechanics.  It turned into something like a horror 
walking simulator becuase of a mix if engine shortcoming and my inaptitude.

Unfortunately, it doesn't work outside the dev environment.  Its time to try 
one of the pro engines, even if it means switching to Windows instead of 
Linux.

This is not released, no permission is granted to use this -- its here to look-at. 
It is very much broken.

Run from the dev environment it looked like this:
